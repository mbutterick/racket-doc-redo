**FAQ**

Q: Why aren't you making these changes in the main Racket repo?

A: Because the documentation & CSS live in separate parts of the main repo until it's built from source. This makes it hard to preview the effects of CSS changes on the docs. This repo is just a way to make it easy for others to see the changes and preview them. Eventually the changed CSS files will be packaged into a pull request for the main Racket repo.

Q: Why doesn't this repo show the current documentation?

A: I copied some docs from the v.5.90.0.9 build. This repo is otherwise disconnected from the main repo.
